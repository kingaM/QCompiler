Scope rules:
1. Each identi?er must be declared in an enclosing scope prior to its use.
2. It is not possible to declare identi?ers of the same name in an overlapping scope.
3. If an identifier has the same name as another identifier in the parent scope, the identifier in the current scope is used. 
4. A user can define a new data type using only defualt data types (bool, int, float, char, string, list, tuple) or a data type previously defined by the user. 
5. A function can only be called by another function if it was previously defined in the program. 
6. Identifiers and data types declared outside a function body or main have global scope. That is they can be used in any place in the program after their definition. 
7. A scope is defined between { and }. 


Type rules:
1. Assignments are legal only if the identifier on the left-hand side and the expression on the right-hand side have the same or compatible type. It is possible to assign an int to a float, but not vice-versa.
2. The test expression of if and repeat statements must have type bool
3. The number and type of actual parameters of a function call must match the number and type of the function’s declared formal parameters.
4. The return statement of a function has to have the same or compatible type as the type declared in the function definiton.
5. For binary operations +, -, *, / and ^ the result of
	int op int = int
	float op float = float
	float op int = int
	int op float = int
   Any other combination is not allowed. 
6. The "." operator only works on user defined types. The expression "id.field" only works when that type has a given id. 
7. No user defined type can be assigned to a different user defined type. I.e. they are not compatible with each other. 
8. Each element of a list has to be of the same type. 
9. For comparison operator the types have to be the same, or compatible. 

Compatible types:
int compatible with float and bool
bool compatible with int
